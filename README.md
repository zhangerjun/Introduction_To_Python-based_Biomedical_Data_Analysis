# An Introduction To Python-based Biomedical Data Analysis

##ã€€Introduction
Initiating a career in bio-imaging can be daunting, particularly for newcomers. It may take them years before stepping
into bio-imaging through traditional school learning. Existing online materials is either two theories or unable to
reproduce for new beginners. Our project, An Introduction to Python-based Bio-Medical Data Analysis, addresses this
challenge through a series of comprehensive mini-projects designed to demystify bio-imaging data processing and
analysis. We aim to facilitate smooth entry into the field for aspiring researchers

## Content
To reach our goal, I have developed 8 mini-projects for this project:
1. Evaluation of Neonatal Brain Tissue Development Using Diffusion MRI
2. HIE rat brain imaging data processing and analysis
3. dMRI Processing Protocol and Reconstruction
4. Use DTITK To Build Template And Do Registration
5. Diffusion MRI reconstruction: code build from scratch
6. Use machine learning to segment cell: UNet Model
7. Preterm or term baby prediction age prediction
8. Useful algorithms for data processing and analysis

Each mini-project uses open-source bioimaging data and popular programming language Python to complete data
preprocessing, reconstruction, and visualization. We will document every step of the process and make all materials
freely available on GitHub
